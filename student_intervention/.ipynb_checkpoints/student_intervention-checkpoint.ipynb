    "\n",
    "General Applications : Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution. Logistic regression is used widely in many fields, including the medical and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths : Logistic regression is intrinsically simple, it has low variance and so is less prone to over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses : Logistic regression will work better if there's a single decision boundary, not necessarily parallel to the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Model #2  : AdaBoostClassifier  ** \n",
    "General Applications :  Adaboost can use multiple instances of the same classifier with different parameters. Thus, a previously linear classifier can be combined into nonlinear classifiers. It can be used in face detection in images, player detection in sports, text-categorization, human-computer spoken dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths : Computationally efficient, no difficult parameters to set, versatile and  a wide range of base learners can be used with AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses : Algorithm seems susceptible to uniform noise. Weak learner should not be too complexto avoid overfitting. There needs to be enough data so that the weak learning\n",
    "requirement is satisfied .The base learner should perform consistently better than random guessing, with generalization error < 0.5 for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Model #3  : SVC ** \n",
    "\n",
    "General Applications : Classification of images, Handwriting recognition, text and hypertext categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths : Safe from overfitting, Can capture complex decision boundary, Quick to train and evaluate. It uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel\n",

    "Decision Tree is a good choice but there are two reasons not to take it :\n",
    "1. Ensemble learning algorithm like AdaBoost can be used which use decision tree as there weak learner. So we don't need to use only decision tree.\n",
    "2. Also as there are lots of feature decision tree will tend to overfit.\n",
    "So DecisionTree is also eliminated.\n",

    "We can choose Logistic Regression as it is intrinsically simple and less prone to overfitting. Using the logistic regression, we'll get a hint of how well any other supervised learning algorithm is expected to perform.\n",

    "1. As LogisticRegressionCV is already generalized and there's not much scope left for further optimization I'd prefer not to chose it though it makes the fastest prediction.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "A SVM is a type of linear separator. Suppose we want to split black circles from the red ones in a X-Y graph by drawing a line. Generally there'd be infinite number of lines that will accomplish this task. SVMs, in particular, find the \"maximum-margin\" line - this is the line \"in the middle\". Intuitively, this works well because it allows for noise and is most tolerant to mistakes on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all a (binary) SVM really is. We draw a straight line through our data down the middle to separate it into two classes. But what if we don't want a straight line but a curved one? We achieve this not by drawing curves, but by \"lifting\" the features we observe into higher dimensions. For example, if we can't draw a line in the space (x1, x2) then we may try adding a third dimension, (x1, x2, x1 * x2). If we project the \"line\" (actually called a \"hyperplane\") in this higher dimension down to our original dimension, it looks like a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "So using SVM, we're able to predict whether the student is going to pass the graduation or needs intervention on the basis of his current performance data we have. Also, as the SVM can handle a lot of features, so in future if we collect more information features about student performance, our model can easily accomodate them and improve if those features provide any useful information."
